            <p class="words">
                "Founded in 2003, AMWAJ RAFTING has been providing thrilling whitewater rafting experiences for
                adventurers of all skill levels. Our founder, Obaroakpo Billy Niesi, was passionate about outdoor
                recreation and
                saw an opportunity to share his love of rafting with others. With just a few rafts and a small team of
                guides, Billy began leading trips on some of the most scenic and challenging rivers in the area. <br>
                <br>
                Over the years, Rafting Adventures has grown to become a leading provider of rafting experiences in the
                region. We now offer a wide range of trips, from calm scenic floats to adrenaline-pumping whitewater
                adventures. Our team of experienced guides are some of the best in the business, with years of
                experience navigating the rapids and ensuring the safety of our guests. <br>
                <br>
                Despite our growth, we remain committed to the same principles that Billy founded the company on. We
                believe that everyone should have the opportunity to experience the thrill of rafting, and we strive to
                provide exceptional service and unforgettable experiences to all of our guests. We look forward to
                continuing to share our passion for rafting with you for many years to come."
